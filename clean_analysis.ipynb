    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completion Rate: The proportion of users who reach the final ‘confirm’ step.\n",
    "- Time Spent on Each Step: The average duration users spend on each step.\n",
    "- Error Rates: If there’s a step where users go back to a previous step, it may indicate confusion or an error. You should consider moving from a later step to an earlier one as an error.\n",
    "- Based on the chosen KPIs, how does the new design’s performance compare to the old one?\n",
    "- You are required to carry out another analysis, ensuring that the observed increase in completion rate from the A/B test meets or exceeds this 5% threshold.\n",
    "- You might want to test whether the average age of clients engaging with the new process is the same as those engaging with the old process\n",
    "- You might want to test if the average client tenure (how long they’ve been with Vanguard) of those engaging with the new process is the same as those engaging with the old process\n",
    "- You might want to test if there are gender differences that affect engaging with the new or old process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Effectiveness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Was the experiment well-structured?\n",
    "- Were clients randomly and equally divided between the old and new designs?\n",
    "- Were there any biases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration Assessment**\n",
    "- Was the timeframe of the experiment (from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017) adequate to gather meaningful data and insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Data Needs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What other data, if available, could enhance the analysis?\n",
    "Bonus: Additional Tasks (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand exactly what changes have been made between the original landing page and the test landing page. What specific design, layout, content, or CTA elements were modified? This will help us pinpoint which changes might influence user behaviour. Data and recordings from softwares such as Hotjar and GA4 (Google Analytics) could help us provide more detailed information about the customers and user behavior and compare it with the current landing page and test landing page.\n",
    "We also want to know more about the products being sold. What are they, what are their prices, and how are they presented on each version of the page? Understanding the business context is important too, in which field or market does the company operate? Who are the competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Hotjar we want to examine:**\n",
    "- Which buttons users are clicking, and which are being ignored.\n",
    "- Heatmaps showing user engagement and scroll behaviour on each landing page of the funnel.\n",
    "- Are users interacting with the forms or CTAs (e.g. “Buy now”, “Subscribe”)?\n",
    "- Session recordings to see how users are navigating and where friction might occur.\n",
    "- How far do users scroll on each version?\n",
    "- On-page surveys to understand what users are thinking (\"What were you looking for?\", \"Was this useful?) - with Hotjar you have the possibility to create a pop-up banner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With GA4, for deeper insights into funnel behaviour, we want to know the following:**\n",
    "- Website performance metrics like page load speed, error rates, or broken elements.\n",
    "- Data information about the devices and browsers of the visitors and customers. Is there for example a difference in behaviour - between desktop and mobile users?\n",
    "- Touch points and channels of where users are coming from? (Do different traffic sources behave differently on version A vs B?)\n",
    "- What is the bounce rate?\n",
    "- Location of the visitors/customers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client Behavior Analysis Interaction Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do clients navigate through the old versus the new digital process? Do they follow similar steps or diverge at certain points?\n",
    "- Consider another hypothesis. Investigate if there’s a difference in the number of actions (steps) taken by users between the Test and Control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power and Effect Size**\n",
    "- Calculate the effect size and post-hoc power for the first test: the new design (Test group) had a higher completion rate compared to the old design (Control group), the hypothesis test checked if this difference was statistically significant.\n",
    "- Let’s assume we are in the phase of designing the experiment for the same hypothesis test. Do Power Analysis to calculate the minimum sample size for an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streamlit**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add Streamlit to your project to achieve Customization and Real-time Analysis."
